<h1>Poplin</h1>
<p>The Poplin project seeks to develop cohesive, free, open-source APIs for states to use in developing a modern, modular Medicaid IT system. Like the poplin fabric that is commonly used to create scrubs for clinical staff, it is our hope that the Poplin project serves as the underlying connective fabric for future Medicaid IT systems.</p>
<p>This Implementation Guide contains FHIR profiles relevant to the Medicaid IT enterprise.</p>

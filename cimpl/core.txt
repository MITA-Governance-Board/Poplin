Grammar:		DataElement 5.0
Namespace:		shr.core
Description:	"The SHR Core domain contains definitions for a variety of general-purpose elements that are used widely in SHR. These include definitions for coding, expressions of time, quantities, addresses, names, and more. 

Relationship to CIMI:
The datatypes in the breast cancer model have been chosen to align with FHIR, not CIMI. Mapping CIMI datatypes was not attempted. Introducing profiles such as CIMI-Quantity, CIMI-CodeableConcept, etc. would lead to unnecessary complication in the resultant profiles."

//------------ Complex Types aligned with FHIR ---------------

Element:		Quantity
Description:	"A quantity with units, whose value may be bounded from above or below, as defined in FHIR.

This definition is not fully consistent with CIMI V0.0.4 (whose definition of Quantity lacks a comparator, but includes numerical precision). Complex data types that appear frequently in FHIR have not been profiled, even if CIMI defines them differently. This choice means that the breast cancer profiles use the native FHIR datatype, rather than having to substitute a CIMI profile everywhere the native type is used."
Value:			0..1 decimal
0..1			Comparator
0..1			Units

		Element:		Comparator
		Value:			code from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/quantity-comparator

		Element:		Units
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"Code for the unit of measure of the quantity."
		Value:			Coding from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/ucum-units

		
Element:		SimpleQuantity
Based on:		Quantity
Description:	"A quantity where the comparator is not used, as defined in FHIR.

This class is not defined in CIMI V0.0.4 reference model. It could potentially be an archetype of Quantity. Complex data types that appear frequently in FHIR have not been profiled, even if CIMI defines them differently. This choice means that the breast cancer profiles use the native FHIR datatype, rather than having to substitute a CIMI profile everywhere the native type is used."
0..0			Comparator

Element:		Age
Based on:		Quantity
Concept:		MTH#C0001779
Description:	"How long something has existed in time."
				Units with Coding from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/units-of-time


//---- Coding departs from CIMI to align with FHIR

Element:		Coding
Concept:		MTH#C0805701
Description:	"Coding of a concept, drawn from a controlled vocabulary. Includes the vocabulary and version, if applicable. May include a display text, and a descriptor expressing the intended interpretation of the code.

A corresponding type does not exist in CIMI V0.0.4. Complex data types that appear frequently in FHIR have not been profiled, even if CIMI defines them differently. This choice means that the breast cancer profiles use the native FHIR datatype, rather than having to substitute a CIMI profile everywhere the native type is used."
Value:			0..1 code
0..1			CodeSystem
0..1 			CodeSystemVersion
0..1			DisplayText

	Element:		CodeSystem
	Concept:		TBD
	Description:	"A formal terminology system."
	Value:			uri

	Element:		CodeSystemVersion
	Concept:		TBD
	Description:	"The version of the vocabulary being used, if applicable."
	Value:			string // Should be id type in FHIR, but it is a string (no issue recorded yet)
	
Element:		CodeableConcept
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"A set of codes drawn from different coding systems, representing the same concept."
0..*			Coding
0..1			DisplayText

Element:		Range
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"An interval defined by a quantitative upper and/or lower bound. One of the two bounds must be specified, and the lower bound must be less than the upper bound. When Quantities are specified, the units of measure must be the same."
0..1			LowerBound value is type SimpleQuantity
0..1			UpperBound value is type SimpleQuantity

	Element:		LowerBound
	Concept:		TBD
	Description:	"The lower limit on a range"
	Value:			Quantity  // or decimal or unsignedInt or integer 

	Element:		UpperBound
	Concept:		TBD
	Description:	"The upper limit on a quantitative value."
	Value:			Quantity  // or decimal or unsignedInt or integer 

Element:		PercentageRange
Based on:		Range
Description:	"A range of percentage values."
0..1			LowerBound value is type Percentage
0..1			UpperBound value is type Percentage
	
Element:		Ratio
Concept:		MTH#C0456603
Description:	"A unit of measurement for the quotient of the amount of one entity to another."
1..1			Numerator
1..1			Denominator

	Element:		Numerator
	Concept:		MTH#C2825219
	Description:	"The dividend of a fraction."
	Value:			Quantity

	Element:		Denominator
	Concept:		MTH#C2825218
	Description:	"The divisor of a fraction."
	Value:			Quantity


Element:		TimePeriod
Concept:		MTH#C1948053
Description:	"A period of time defined by a start and end time, date, or year. 

If the start element is missing, the start of the period is not known. If the end element is missing, it means that the period is ongoing, or the start may be in the past, and the end date in the future, which means that period is expected/planned to end at the specified time. The end value includes any matching date/time. For example, the period 2011-05-23 to 2011-05-27 includes all the times from the start of the 23rd May through to the end of the 27th of May."
0..1			TimePeriodStart
0..1			TimePeriodEnd  // lack of end time indicates the period was continuing at the time the entry was created

	Element: 		TimePeriodStart    // synonym "EffectiveDate"
	Concept: 		MTH#C1301880
	Description: 	"The time at which something is to take effect, start, or did start. Boundary is considered inclusive."
	Value:			dateTime   // TODO: would like to have date or dateTime but that wouldn't be FHIR-compatible

	Element:		TimePeriodEnd
	Concept:		MTH#C1522314
	Description:	"The time at which something is to end or did end. Boundary is considered inclusive."
	Value:			dateTime   // TODO: would like to have date or dateTime but that wouldn't be FHIR-compatible

Value:			CodeableConcept from ClockDirectionVS


// -----------  Age --------------------------

Element:		AgeRange
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"A quantitative range of ages. One of the two ages must be specified."
// Since Lower and Upper bounds in Range are based on SimpleQuantity and Age is based on Quantity, there is no way to make AgeRange a subtype of Range

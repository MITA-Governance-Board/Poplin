# Reference-Architecture

This project, sponsored by the MITA Governance Board created by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), seeks to create a reference architecture for Medicaid Management Information Systems (MMIS) to coordinate the mission, vision, and strategy and provide technical specifications that ensure interoperability of modules and information across multi-organization, multi-vendor, and multi-technology systems.

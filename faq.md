## What is the Poplin project?
The Poplin project seeks to develop a cohesive, free, open-source reference architecture for states to use in developing a modern, modular Medicaid IT system.  Like the poplin fabric that is commonly used to create scrubs for clinical staff, it is our hope that the Poplin project serves as the underlying connective fabric for future Medicaid IT systems.

## Why does Poplin exist?
The Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS) would like to encourage IT Vendors to provide states with modern, modular, targeted Medicaid IT solutions.  This contrasts with the current MMIS solutions that need to fulfill all business requirements for a state's Medicaid program.  Poplin's goals are:

- Enable fine-grain modularity
- Promote reusability, interoperability, and innovation
- Support migration paths
- Establish a trust framework for nationwide information exchange


## Who could benefit from using or joining Poplin?
Any organization affiliated with Medicaid IT systems stands to benefit from the use of Poplin. Currently, we are targeting these organizations in particular:

- [Health IT Developers](/developers)
- [State Medicaid and Health and Human Services agencies](/states)
- [Medicaid IT Vendors](/vendors)

## What is a reference architecture?
A reference architecture establishes service definitions, data transfer methods, and file standards.  This allows vendors to focus on building those services and allows states to build an MMIS system from multiple interoperable modules.  Service definitions leverage a number of standards, including [UML](http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/), [SysML](http://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/), [UAF](http://www.omg.org/spec/UAF/), [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification), and [MITA 3.0](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/data-and-systems/mita/mita-30/index.html)

## Where did Poplin come from?
Currently, the Poplin project is being stewarded by the [Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS)](https://www.medicaid.gov/), with assistance from [MITRE's](https://www.mitre.org) [CMS Alliance to Modernize Healthcare](https://www.mitre.org/centers/cms-alliances-to-modernize-healthcare/who-we-are), the [Vermont Agency of Human Services](http://humanservices.vermont.gov/), and [CNSI](http://www.cns-inc.com/), among others.

## What is the Poplin project?
The Poplin project seeks to develop a cohesive, free, open-source reference architecture for states to use in developing a modern, modular Medicaid system.  Like the poplin fabric that is commonly used to create scrubs for clinical staff, it is our hope that the Poplin project serves as the underlying connective fabric for future Medicaid systems.

## Why does Poplin exist?
The Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS) would like to encourage IT Vendors to provide states with modern, modular, targeted Medicaid IT solutions.  This contrasts with the current MMIS solutions that need to fulfill all business requirements for a state's Medicaid program.

## Who could benefit from using or joining Poplin?
Any organization affiliated with Medicaid IT systems stands to benefit from the use of Cedar. Currently, we are targeting these organizations in particular:

- [Health IT Developers](/developers)
- [State Medicaid and Health and Human Services agencies](/states)
- [Medicaid IT Vendors](/vendors)

## Where did Poplin come from?
Currently, the Poplin project is being stewarded by the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS), with assistance from [MITRE's](mitre.org) [CMS Alliance to Modernize Healthcare](https://www.mitre.org/centers/cms-alliances-to-modernize-healthcare/who-we-are), the [Vermont Agency of Human Services](http://humanservices.vermont.gov/), and [CNSI](http://www.cns-inc.com/), among others.
